#  A Guide to Broadcasting from Home

## Broadcast Setup

My mirrorless SLR camera is my device of choice for broadcasts. The quality of the SLR, for me, is outstanding. Another benefit is the ability to swap out lenses, depending on need.

Here's a look at my overall setup (again, credit to David Eaves for the inspiration)

## Equipment

### Audio

- Rode Wireless Go: Pairing this device with the Rode Lav Mic gives you the freedom to roam around while presenting.

### Video

- Sony A6400 Camera: A really neat feature of this camera is the ability to use the screen as a preview monitor. This is a great thing to have, especially when lining up framing.
- Sony SIGMA 30MM F1.4 lens: This is a great lens that offers the ability to have really blurred backgrounds to make you "pop" on screen.
elgato Cam Link 4K: This is the device responsible for converting the HDMI signal to USB as a camera input. It's plug-and-play and includes a USB 3.0 extension cable.

### Lighting and Stand

- Bi-Color LED Ring Light: Lets you adjust the colour temperature, which is a really great feature when balancing indoor lighting. This ring light comes with an attachment that allows you to position the SLR in the centre.
- Light Stand: This is usually sold separately from the ring light, so it's best to get this as part of your set. Height adjustment is key here, especially if you want to switch things up between standing and sitting.
- iPad Pro as Secondary Monitor

If a compatible iPad is available (read: not in use by a family member), I'd highly recommend using it as a secondary monitor for your Mac.

**A couple key things to keep in mind for this type of setup:**

1. Activate Sidecar to display in the "Extended" format (not "Mirror"); and
2. Update settings in Keynote to enable "Presenter View."
3. Worried about running over time? You can set a timer to countdown what time you have remaining. You can do this by adjusting the settings icon in the presenter view in rehearsal mode.

### Broadcast Capture

The capture card, or converter, is a key component of the setup. This is the device responsible for converting HDMI to USB for use by the computer. In my case, I opted for elgato Cam Link 4K.

It's important to note, however, that not every SLR camera may be compatible with this device. Before reading on, be sure to check out their compatibility page.

As noted on elgato's site, your DSLR will need to support both:

- Clean HDMI output, described as "footage that excludes overlays such as recording time, remaining storage space, focus point, and more." The site notes, "If these overlays cannot be deactivated, Cam Link will capture them."
- Unlimited runtime, which refers to "a cameraâ€™s ability to function for as long as it is powered on." The site goes on to point out "Many DSLR cameras shut down after a certain period to preserve battery power."

If your device is capable of supporting both of these functions, you should be good to go.

As with any piece of technology, keep in mind that extended use may cause the device to overheat; it may shut down to preserve its functions.

It might be best to experiment with an older SLR device, especially if you're planning on using this as a full-time setup.
