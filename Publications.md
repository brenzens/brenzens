## Cyber City Safe: Emergency Planning Beyond the Maginot Line

Co-author of *Cyber City Safe: Emergency Planning Beyond the Maginot Line*. This book paints a picture of a Cyber City, safe from a range of threats and challenges. Big data will play a positive role. Sensors throughout the city will monitor the weather in the short term and climate in the long term.

Big data will advise on the type of plantings which will thrive now, and also in the next generation when there will be a different climate. Automatic water collection and distribution systems will ensure that even in droughts, scarce water will be put to best use. Solar-powered awnings and baffles will shield pedestrians from wind, sun, and rain, extending the pleasant walking season and promoting fitness and health.
